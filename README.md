# ArtGeneratorProject

This is a personal project inspired by the cellular automatons and lindenmayer generators that I've created for a uni course. 
Link to the repository of that project: https://github.com/ArdaMT/CellularAutomatons_LindenmayerGenerators

In the curren project I created an image generator that uses the random function trees to create beautiful images in different colours.
I utilise different trigonometric functions with cosine and sine to create the random function trees. I then translate the tree
into an image whose colour is either randomly assigned or chosen via a text field input. For each image, metrics such as the seed, 
tree depth and colour hue are provided in the console output. These three metrics allow to recreate an image, if one wants to, by using 
the custom image option of the program. The images can also be saved as .png files.
